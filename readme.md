** Notes**

```
React Native comes up with  some components which i can use, and which
can be rendered into native code


Main Ones

import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'


(a)View-Its Like a Div

(b)Text is like <p>

(c)Sylesheet--an Object where i can put styles in Key value pairs



 container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },


  (a)Align Items-Centers Elements in the cross axis


  (b)Justify content-Centers Elements in the Main Axis

```


**EyeOpener**

```

TouchableOpacity and a Button are the Only Two React Native components with OnPress
Even....

If i want the ablity to detect a touch on anything else rather than a button i can 
touchableOpacity.
